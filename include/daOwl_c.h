/* The owl actor (ROM RTTI name daOwl_c, registry profile OWL). It hovers near
 * a perch, talks to the player when approached, and afterwards can pick the
 * player up and carry it (the carry state pins the actor to the rider's
 * matrix). Five states drive it; see the table in daOwl_c.cpp.
 *
 * Derives from dEnemyBase_c, and the class's own destructor is what proves it:
 * `_ZN7daOwl_cD1Ev` stores this vtable, destroys the four members below in
 * reverse declaration order, then calls `dEnemyBase_c::~dEnemyBase_c`.
 *
 * The four members close exactly on each other, four independent
 * confirmations of one layout:
 *
 *     0x110 dCcAcPos_c  0x40   -> 0x150
 *     0x150 dBgCh_Actr  0x1bc  -> 0x30c
 *     0x30c ModelAnim   0x64   -> 0x370
 *     0x370 ShadowModel 0x28   -> 0x398
 *
 * and dEnemyBase_c's own 0x110 closes exactly on the first of them.
 *
 * Typing them absorbed four markers that were their insides:
 *   - unk_128 = mdCcAcPos_c.flags  (dCc_c +0x18)
 *   - mAnimation = the ModelAnim's Animation base (+0x50)
 *   - unk_364 = that Animation's currFrame (+0x08); Behavior reads it as
 *     `>> 12`, the integer frame of a 20.12 fixed-point count
 *   - unk_368 = that Animation's speed (+0x0c); Behavior copies mAnimSpeed
 *     into it, and InitResources sets mAnimSpeed to 0x1000, which is 1.0
 *
 * Size is the ROM's own, not a rounded-up field span: `daOwl_c_classInit`
 * calls `fBase_c::operator new(1016)` -- 0x3f8 -- and stores `_ZTV7daOwl_c`.
 * The fields below span to 0x3f4; the rest is trailing space no source reads.
 *
 * daOwl_c_classInit at 0x02136798 allocates 0x3f8 and installs the vtable. It
 * backs the OWL registry profile, whose descriptor at 0x02136a34 is
 * reconstructed as g_profile_OWL. The factory and profile spellings are
 * source-style names, not recovered SM64DS symbols.
