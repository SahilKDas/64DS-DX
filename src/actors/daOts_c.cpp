/* daOts_c -- shared base of the three Bully variants (BULLY 215 / BIG_BULLY 216
 * / CHILL_BULLY 217 (debug ICE_DONKETU)), ov064 0x02115ee0..0x02117070.
 *
 * ov064 is mixed (treasure chest, metal net lift, LLL tilting platform, daKpa_c
 * puzzle, rotating firebar, lava bubble, bully, water ring, jet stream, clam).
 * RTTI names this class daOts_c; overlay_actors maps the three children to
 * BULLY 215 / BIG_BULLY 216 / CHILL_BULLY 217 (debug ICE_DONKETU). Ugly RTTI
 * name is final.
 *
 * One translation unit, twenty-four functions, the way the cartridge's own build
 * had it. This replaces twenty-four one-function shards; their content is
 * unchanged except where several of them carried stand-in `ModelAnim` and
 * `dActor_c` structs that cannot coexist with include/daOts_c.h in a single TU,
 * and where four different spellings of the same two ROM symbols had to be
 * collapsed into one (see the extern block below). InitResourcesCommon and
 * BehaviorCommon sat immediately after Render as leftover shards; they belong
 * here (this-pointer layout plus named daOts callees), not with daDonketu_c.
 *
 * THIS TU OWNS THE CLASS VTABLE. CleanupResources (vtable slot 3) is the first
 * virtual daOts_c declares out of line -- the destructor is inline in the class
 * body on purpose, so that the three derived classes inline its vptr store --
 * which makes CleanupResources the key function and anchors _ZTV7daOts_c
 * (ov064 0x0211b768) here, along with the D1/D0 pair the table points at.
 *
 * The RTTI records do NOT live in this overlay. _ZTI7daOts_c and _ZTS7daOts_c
 * are vague-linkage symbols the linker kept in ov027 (0x021138bc and
 * 0x021138a4), next to daIDonketu_c's own pair; ov064's vtable header word at
 * 0x0211b764 relocates across to them. None of that data lies inside this
 * entry's licensed .text range, so dsd supplies the cartridge's own bytes and
 * production isolation discards the emitted duplicates; the manifest's
 * compiler_only_output block licenses each one at its measured ROM home.
 *
 * The shards for D1 and D0 each needed a forcing scaffold (`p->~daOts_c()` and
 * a stand-in `CleanupResources` returning 0). This file needs neither: it owns
 * the real key function, so the vtable emission drags both variants in by
 * itself.
 *
 * FUNCTION ORDER IS THE REVERSE OF THE ROM'S -- mwccarm 2004/b56 emits one
 * .text section per function in reverse source order, so the highest-address
 * ROM function is written first. Do not reorder.
 *
 * No factory: the class is abstract (slots 0 and 6 are zero). Children own
 * daDonketu_c_classInit / daBDonketu_c_classInit / daIDonketu_c_classInit.
 *
 *
 * deslop leftovers:
 * - SetAnim 6az: helpers pass Fix12<int> by value; header method form size-DIFFs.
 * - DropShadowRadHeight 6az: func_ov064_02116bac.
 * - IsTooFarAwayFromPlayer / IsPlayerInRange(Fix12,Fix12,Fix12,s32) 6az:
 *   func_ov064_021165d8 / 02116560. Header methods carry Fix12<int>.
 * - KillByInvincibleChar 6az: func_ov064_02116754.
 * - Particle::System::New / NewSimple 6az: func_ov064_0211616c / 02115f98.
 * - _Z14ApproachLinearRiii stays mangled; no header method form here.
 * - func_0201267c: PlayStepSound / PlayHitSound / PlayDeathSound at mCamSpacePosX.
 * - SharedFilePtr +4: SetAnim BCA loads; SharedFilePtr.h has no fields.
 * - 0x398..0x3f9 stay children's padding (annexing them as members would move
 *   the fields the children declare from 0x3fa on); the helpers reach them
 *   through daOts_c::tail(), a cast of the whole object to the nested Tail struct
 *   (a Tail that starts at 0x398 costs an extra add per address-of).
 * - func_ov064_* helpers still in this TU keep cartridge addresses (no
 *   identifiers). InitResourcesCommon / BehaviorCommon are the two that
 *   were leftover shards; names describe the children's slot-0 / slot-6
 *   wrappers.
 * - InitResourcesCommon 6az: dCcAc_c::Init / dBgCh_Actr::Init / SetAnim
 *   keep mangled forms (Fix12<int> by value). SharedFilePtr +4 for the BCA.
 * - BehaviorCommon: the mStateTimer increment stays unsigned short (ldrh).
 * - daOts_c.h first: nested Matrix4x3 for mModelAnim.mat4x3.t (02116bac).
 *   common.h's flat m[12] would stand down if it came first.
 * - Vec3_Sub / HorzLen / atan2 take int*; 02115f98 keeps the int-array pos copy.
 * - (long long)/(s64) 20.12 muls in 02116bac / 02115f98.
 * - bool-widening `int isD8 = (int)(actorID == kBigBullyActorId)` / `isBf` in
 *   02116754 / 02116460: the temporary is load-bearing.
 * - CleanupResources and InitResourcesCommon read the config block through
 *   mFileTable every time; caching it in a local size-DIFFs.
 * - func_ov064_021163c0: `c->mPrevAngleY += 0x8000` is the match form (a
 *   separate read and add of the field size-DIFFs).
 * - mStateTimer compares stay unsigned short (ldrh) in 0211616c / 02116460 /
 *   021163c0; named s16 > / < DIFFs.
 *
 * Leftover (what is still not recovered, or only known by what the code does):
 * - Names. State, animation-slot and sound names describe the behaviour of the
 *   handlers in this TU; the stripped image carries none of the originals. The
 *   six STATE_* names, mHomePos, mPosBeforeMove, mHopCount and the kAnim* slot
 *   names are readings of use, not recovered identifiers.
 * - mHomePos is dual-use: InitResourcesCommon seeds it with the spawn position
 *   and the death branch of func_ov064_02116220 overwrites it with the death spot
 *   for the particles.
 * - mPrevAngleY looks like the travel heading: the hit reactions set it, the
 *   walking states copy it into mAngleY after moving, and
 *   dActor_c::UpdatePosWithHorzSpeedAndAng reads the s16 at 0x94 as the angle it
 *   moves along. Its real name is not settled here.
 * - The Tail view stands in for members: the children's pad_398 and fields from
 *   0x3fa on still sit where a real daOts_c would end. No function in this TU
 *   reads or writes byte 0x3f8.
 * - InitResourcesCommon does not write Tail::mState; where it is first set is
 *   not established here.
 * - Player::Hurt's literal arguments (0, 0x14000, 1, 0, 1) are not interpreted.
 * - Player::param1 == 2 in the hit reaction (the 50-unit rather than 40-unit
 *   knockback) is unexplained, as is hit flag 0x40000's identity.
 * - Surface types 1, 4, 5 and 0x13 (func_ov064_02116220) are unnamed.

 * shard needed a stand-in CleanupResources to make the compiler emit the

 * (slot 3), the class's key function, so the vtable is emitted here and drags
 * both destructor variants with it.
 *
 * D0 is the deleting half: destroy through daOts_c's four members and
 * dEnemyBase_c, then hand the object back through Memory::Deallocate.

 * every one of those offsets is where the members' asserted sizes put them.
