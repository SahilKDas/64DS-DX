rem This list is port\kit_assets.txt, and port\tools\kit_smoke.py checks that
rem the two still agree. It used to test three files, and the three it tested
rem happened to be the three an OLD extraction already had. So when the game
rem started needing the nitrofs tables, an install that predated them sailed
rem past this check, skipped the unpack that would have written them, and died
rem on a missing file about a fifth of a second later. A partial check is worse
rem than none: it is a check that says "unpacked" about an install it never
rem looked at properly.
rem
rem A missing file here costs one re-extraction. Getting it wrong costs a
rem player a game that will not start and has no way to repair itself.
