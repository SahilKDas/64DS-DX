/* Derives from dEnemyBase_c, and TWO INDEPENDENT WITNESSES agree on the layout:
 * the class's own destructor `_ZN7daIbl_cD1Ev` destroys each member, and
 * `daIbl_c_classInit` constructs the same types at the same offsets before
 * storing `_ZTV7daIbl_c`. Everything this header used to restate below
 * 0x110 belongs to dEnemyBase_c and dActor_c and is inherited now.
 *
 * The members close on each other, which is what makes the layout a
 * reading rather than a guess:
 *
 *     0x110 dBgCh_Actr               0x1bc   -> 0x2cc
 *     0x2cc Model                      0x50    -> 0x31c
 *     0x31c ShadowModel                0x28    -> 0x344
 *     0x374 dCcAc_c         0x34    -> 0x3a8
 *     0x3f4 PathPtr                    0x8     -> 0x3fc
 *
 * THE FIFTH MEMBER HAS NO DESTRUCTOR, so only the factory witnesses it:
 * daIbl_c_classInit constructs a PathPtr at 0x3f4 that the destructor
 * never destroys, PathPtr's being trivial. 0x3f4 + 8 is 0x3fc, exactly the
 * allocation literal -- the layout does not close without it. Reading only
 * the destructor leaves the class eight bytes short.
 *
 * Every function of the class reproduces, in one translation unit:
 * src/actors/daIbl_c.cpp is the whole linker unit 0x02141f04..0x021431c4,
 * factory included.
 *
 * SIZE IS THE ROM'S OWN: `daIbl_c_classInit` calls
 * `fBase_c::operator new(1020)` -- 0x3fc -- and stores this class's
 * vtable, so that literal IS this class's sizeof.
 *
 * SM64DS RTTI names the implementation daIbl_c: _ZTS7daIbl_c at
 * 0x02147f40, _ZTI7daIbl_c at 0x02147f4c, and the vtable _ZTV7daIbl_c at
 * 0x02147f7c that the factory and destructor store. The reconstructed
 * factory daIbl_c_classInit (historical alias
 * RollingIronBall_Spawn) constructs it for the IRONBALL
 * registry profile.

/* Behavior's table is indexed by mVariant (param1's low nibble). The names say

 *   0  func_ov100_02142b90: never drawn (Render skips it); a timer-driven
 *      spawner that creates another IRONBALL actor while the closest player is
 *      inside its distance band.
 *   1  func_ov100_02142918: rolls freely, bouncing off walls and speeding up
 *      down slopes.
 *   2  func_ov100_021424c0: follows the path, speed changing with the slope.
 *   3  func_ov100_0214272c: rolls on with no path until it drops below
 *      mKillY or runs into a wall, then breaks up. A path follower turns into
 *      this kind when its path index wraps.
 *   4  func_ov100_021424c0 again: the same handler as 2, but on the ground its
 *      speed climbs linearly to the 35 units/frame cap instead of following
