/* The propeller Shy Guy's fireball (registry profile PROPELLER_HEYHO_FIRE).
 * The cartridge's RTTI names the class: _ZTI24daPropeller_Heyho_Fire_c at
 * 0x0210d608, _ZTS24daPropeller_Heyho_Fire_c at 0x0210d614, and the vtable
 * _ZTV24daPropeller_Heyho_Fire_c at 0x0210d654 that the factory and destructor store.
 *
 * Derives from dEnemyBase_c, on the evidence of its own destructor: `_ZN24daPropeller_Heyho_Fire_cD1Ev`
 * stores this vtable, destroys its members in reverse declaration order, then
 * calls `dEnemyBase_c::~dEnemyBase_c`. Everything this header used to restate below 0x110
 * belongs to that chain and is inherited now.
 *
 * The members close exactly on one another:
 *
 *     0x110 dCcAc_c         0x34   -> 0x144
 *     0x144 dBgCh_Actr               0x1bc  -> 0x300
 *     0x300 Model                      0x50   -> 0x350
 *
 * Member NAMES are the ones this header already used -- a rebase should not
 * also rename things its callers spell.
 *
 * SIZE IS THE OBSERVED FIELD SPAN, rounded up. It guards this declaration; it
 * is not independent evidence about the ROM.
