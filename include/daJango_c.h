/* Derives from dEnemyBase_c, on the evidence of its own destructor: `_ZN9daJango_cD1Ev`
 * stores this vtable, destroys its members in reverse declaration order, then
 * calls `dEnemyBase_c::~dEnemyBase_c`. Everything this header used to restate below 0x110
 * belongs to that chain and is inherited now.
 *
 * The members close exactly on one another, and dEnemyBase_c's own 0x110 closes
 * exactly on the first. Member NAMES are the ones this header already used --
 * a rebase should not also rename things its callers spell:
 *
 *     0x110 dCcAc_c       0x34   -> 0x144
 *     0x144 dCcAc_c       0x34   -> 0x178
 *     0x178 dBgCh_Actr             0x1bc  -> 0x334
 *     0x334 BlendModelAnim           0x70   -> 0x3a4
 *     0x3a4 ShadowModel              0x28   -> 0x3cc
 *
 * SIZE IS THE OBSERVED FIELD SPAN, rounded up. It guards this declaration; it
 * is not independent evidence about the ROM.
 *
 * SM64DS RTTI names the implementation daJango_c. The reconstructed factory
 * daJango_c_classInit (0x0211ce80, historical alias Klepto_Spawn)
 * installs this class's cartridge vtable and lives in
 * src/actors/daJango_c.cpp alongside the rest of the class; the
 * reconstructed profile global g_profile_JANGO (historical alias
 * Klepto_SpawnInfo) is its registry descriptor.
