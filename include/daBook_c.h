/* Derives from dEnemyBase_c, and TWO INDEPENDENT WITNESSES agree on the layout: the
 * class's own destructor `_ZN8daBook_cD1Ev` destroys each member, and
 * `daBook_c_classInit_SHOOT_BOOK` constructs the same types at the same offsets after
 * storing `_ZTV8daBook_c`. Everything this header used to restate below 0x110
 * belongs to dEnemyBase_c and dActor_c and is inherited now.
 *
 * The members close on each other, which is what makes the layout a reading
 * rather than a guess:
 *
 *     0x110 ModelAnim                  0x64    -> 0x174
 *     0x174 Model                      0x50    -> 0x1c4
 *     0x1c4 ShadowModel                0x28    -> 0x1ec
 *     0x1ec Matrix4x3                  0x30    -> 0x21c
 *     0x21c dCcAcPos_c  0x40    -> 0x25c
 *     0x25c dBgCh_Actr               0x1bc   -> 0x418
 *
 * SIZE IS THE ROM'S OWN: `daBook_c_classInit_SHOOT_BOOK` calls `fBase_c::operator new(1108)`
 * -- 0x454 -- and stores this class's vtable, so that literal IS this
 * class's sizeof.
 *
 * NAME. The cartridge's RTTI names this class daBook_c: _ZTS8daBook_c at
 * ov020 0x0211482c, _ZTI8daBook_c at 0x02114844, _ZTV8daBook_c at 0x0211495c.
 * It was carried here under the coined name BookShot until that was replaced
 * by the ROM's. The reconstructed factory
 * daBook_c_classInit_SHOOT_BOOK (historical alias BookShot_Spawn) installs this class's
 * cartridge vtable for the SHOOT_BOOK registry profile.
