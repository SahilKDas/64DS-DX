/* TWO WITNESSES:
 *
 *   daChoropu_c_classInit  fBase_c::operator new(396 = 0x18c),
 *       dActor_c::dActor_c(), stores _ZTV11daChoropu_c, then the two members
 *       below in this order.
 *   _ZN11daChoropu_cD0Ev  the same two members destroyed in reverse, then
 *       ~dActor_c.
 *
 * SIZE 0x18c is the factory's own literal; mEmergeSystemID (4 bytes, 0x188) closes
 * exactly on it.
 *
 * Everything below 0x0d0 duplicated dActor_c's own fields under placeholder
 * names -- dActor_c ends at exactly 0x0d0, so unk_008 (dActor_c/fBase_c's
 * own param1 at 0x008) is the only pre-0xd0 field this class's consumers
 * touched; it was repointed to the inherited fBase_c name.
 *
 * THE VTABLE was diffed slot by slot against _ZTV8dActor_c. daChoropu_c
 * overrides slot 0 (InitResources), slot 3 (CleanupResources), slot 6
 * (Behavior) and slot 9 (Render) -- all still fBase_c's own slots in
 * dActor_c -- plus slot 29 (OnAimedAtWithEgg). Every other slot holds the
 * base's own word and is inherited, so it is deliberately not redeclared
 * here.
 *
 * SM64DS RTTI names the implementation daChoropu_c. The reconstructed
 * factory daChoropu_c_classInit (historical alias
 * MontyMole_Spawn) constructs it for the CHOROPU
 * registry profile.
