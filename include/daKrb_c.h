/* Goomba (KURIBO 200 / KURIBO_S 201 / KURIBO_L 202) -- ov084/daKrb_c.
 *
 * RTTI ov084:0x021308d4 is the length-prefixed string 7daKrb_c;
 * _ZTI7daKrb_c at 0x021308e0 points its name word there and its base
 * at dCapEnemy_c. The tree used to carry this class under the coined
 * English name Goomba.
 *
 * Factories daKrb_c_classInit_KURIBO / _S / _L allocate 0x478 bytes;
 * that is this class's size. Member NAMES below are from this TU's
 * own methods.
 *
 * SM64DS RTTI names the implementation daKrb_c. The reconstructed
 * factories daKrb_c_classInit_KURIBO / _S / _L (historical aliases
 * Goomba_Spawn / GoombaSmall_Spawn / GoombaLarge_Spawn) install this
 * class's cartridge vtable; the reconstructed profile globals
 * g_profile_KURIBO / _S / _L are the registry descriptors. Exact
