 * rename). The ROM records a single dActor_c base at offset zero; its vtable is
 * at 0x02113844.
 *
 * The factory allocates 0x10c bytes, constructs dActor_c, then constructs the
 * dCcAc_c at 0x0d4. Both destructor variants destroy that member before
 * chaining to dActor_c, independently proving its ownership and the extent.
 * The remaining word is the unique ID of the daObjDlPyramid_c (the pyramid top) this tag reports to.
 *
 * The 31-slot ROM vtable has the same extent as dActor_c and overrides only
 * slots 0, 6, 16, and 17. The original code TU is shared with daObjDlPyramid_c and
 * four daObjDlPyramid_c-only helpers: src/actors/daObjDlPyramid_c.cpp. */
